## WATCH List

### Motivational
- [x] [The School of Life, The Imposter Syndrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqhUHyVpAwE): Everyone has the same chaotic and depressed thoughts and self-doubt that we have. We know ourselves from the inside, but others from the outside with their edited content.
- [x] [Alan Watkins, Being Brilliant Every Single Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRItG9G1rb4): Being challenged leads to physiological chaos and brain gets shut down. Changing biological context leads to more quality thinking: Breath to get conscious control over (rhythm and smoothness are important). Emotional positivity is a performance enhancer.
- [x] [John O'Leary, The Importance of Good Conversation and How to Have it](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_o_leary_the_importance_of_good_conversation_and_how_to_have_it#t-2129): Quality of our conversations influences the quality of our decisions. To get honest opinion "I really want to know what you think" is not enough, have to change the context of the conversation. Technique 1: Independent deliberation (for example ask everyone to write down their recommendation) Technique 2: Devil's Advocate/Red Team
- [x] [Julien Treasure, How to Speak so that People Want to Listen](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen): Honesty(be clear and straight), Authenticity(be yourself), Integrity(be your word), Love(wish them well). Do not talk monotonously. Using voice toolbox. Voice exercises before speech.
- [x] [Julien Treasure, 5 Ways to Listen Better](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better#t-5856): We are losing our listening. Consious listening creates understanding. Exercises to improve consious listening: 1. Daily 3 minutes of silence 2. Mixer, how many channels i hear 3. Enjoying mundane sounds 4. Listening positions(active\passive, reductive\expansive, critical\emphathetic) 5. RASA (Receive, Appreciate, Summarize, Ask)
- [x] [Matt Abrahams, Think Fast, Talk Smart: Communication Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAnw168huqA): Spontaneous speaking is stressful. Anxiety management techniques: Greet anxiety, it is a normal and natural. Reframe this is a conversation, not a performance (There is no one way to make it correct).Start with questions to include audience (even can be rhetorical). Use conversational language. Be in the present-moment, don't worry about future consequences. Might use saying a tongue twister, it will force to be in the moment and will warm up the voice. Ground rules: 1. Get ourselves out of the way (Dare to be dull, do not over-analyse) 2. See spontenous conversation as an opportunity to respond. ("yes, and" instead of "no, but") 3. Slow down and listen (instead of jumping how to respond) 4. Respond in a way structured, tell a story.Key to successful speech is structure.(Example structure: Problem or Opportunity > Solution > benefit) (Example Structure: What > So What > Now What) Structure sets us free. **[Handouts](https://nofreakingspeaking.com/)** [Summary of the speech](https://nofreakingspeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Be-Confident-When-Called-On-Abrahams.pdf)
